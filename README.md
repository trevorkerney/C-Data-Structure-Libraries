# C++ Data Structure Libraries 

I'm writing these to gain greater control and knowledge of my code.

### Lists
- TVector - Managed positioning: objects pushed to end and pulled from end / synchronized / sequential memory
- TArray - Unmanaged positioning: essentially a basic array with automatic resizing / unsynchronized / sequential memory
- TQueue (n/a) - Managed queue positioning: objects pushed to end and pulled from start / synchronized / nonsequential memory
- TStack (AKA TLinkedVector) (n/a) - Managed stack positioning: objects pushed to end and pulled from end / synchronized / nonsequential memory

### Monitoring
- TSubject (n/a) - 
- TObserver (n/a) -
