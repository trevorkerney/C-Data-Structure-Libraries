# C++ Design Patterns

I'm writing these to gain greater control and knowledge of my code.

All of these fall under the MIT license unless there is a different license within the design pattern's directory.

### Lists
- TVector - Managed positioning: objects pushed to end and pulled from end / synchronized / sequential memory
- TArray - Unmanaged positioning: essentially a basic array with resizing functions / unsynchronized / sequential memory
- TQueue (N/A) - Managed queue positioning: objects pushed to end and pulled from start / synchronized / nonsequential memory
- TStack (AKA TLinkedVector) (N/A) - Managed stack positioning: objects pushed to end and pulled from end / synchronized / nonsequential memory
